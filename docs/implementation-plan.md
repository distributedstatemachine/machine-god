# Implementation plan

Status values: `NOT STARTED`, `IN PROGRESS`, `BLOCKED`, `COMPLETE`.

## Objective

Build a high-performance Rust 1.94.1 coding-agent engine inspired by
`vercel-labs/fx`. Local development and CI use the declared minimum toolchain
exactly. Local `+stable` is a narrowly scoped fallback for this checkout's
damaged exact-toolchain installation and is valid only while both local Rust and
Cargo report release 1.94.1 exactly.
The embeddable asynchronous engine is the primary product; the CLI is its native
reference host. Observable performance and compatibility claims require retained
evidence against the pinned upstream revision. Product claims use committed,
reviewed summaries with input and result digests. The 90-day bootstrap workflow
artifact is non-product evidence of the collection path and may expire without
weakening those durable claim records.

## Delivery workflow

Every feature uses `agent/mNN-feature-slug`, isolated subagent worktrees, local
checks, three fresh adversarial reviewers, a pushed feature branch, remote CI for
the exact SHA, and a fast-forward push to `main`. Confirmed review findings are
fixed and rereviewed until none remain. Rejected findings are documented under
`docs/reviews/`. CI executes third-party actions by reviewed immutable commit,
keeps checkout credentials disabled, and grants the workflow read-only contents
permission. Python `test_*.py` files are discovered repo-wide in deterministic
order, excluding generated and checkout state under `.bench`, `.git`, and
`target`. Workspace tests execute natively on pinned Linux and macOS x86_64 and
aarch64 runner labels rather than relying on cross-compilation alone.

Milestone 02 completion evidence is retained in the
[milestone review](reviews/m02-milestone-review.md). Milestone 03 is in progress
with thirteen integrated bounded slices. The first
provides read-only native config/state
discovery, a fixed `ask` permission-mode report, and help/version/status CLI
behavior. The second adds synchronous read-only native loading of an exact
schema-v1 `ask` config, bounded to 64 KiB with fail-closed file and content
validation. Missing or unavailable configuration uses explicit built-in
defaults; configuration mutation is not implemented. The third adds
capability-aware tool preflight: the source-compatible default preserves the
raw `Capability::Tool` request, while a tool may prepare a normalized capability
and the exact arguments that an allowed execution receives. Core bounds the
prepared arguments at the existing exact byte limit and gives capability
serialization one total byte cap equal to that limit plus 1 KiB of fixed
headroom before policy. JSON depth and node traversal applies to the prepared
arguments and only the JSON values embedded in `Tool` or `Custom` capabilities.
Preparation is synchronous, bounded, nonblocking, effect-free trusted-host work
with immediate before/after cancellation checks; its arguments may drive only
effects within the authorized capability. Preparation failure produces a
durable generic tool error without consulting policy or exercising the tool.
The fourth slice adds the first executable native tool: a Unix-hardened,
read-only `read_file` capability rooted in an absolute workspace selected and
opened explicitly by the host. Its pure preflight accepts only a strict
`{path:string}` input, bounds that UTF-8 path at 4,096 bytes, and gives policy
and execution the same normalized workspace-relative path. Allowed execution
walks retained directory descriptors without following any component symlink,
accepts only a regular file, retains at most 8 KiB plus one overflow-detection
byte, and returns only valid UTF-8. The exact contract is in
[`read-file.md`](read-file.md). The fifth slice adds `list_files`, a
Unix-hardened, read-only, one-directory enumeration rooted in an explicit
absolute host path whose directory descriptor is retained. Its pure
preflight accepts only `{}` or a sole string `path`, defaults an omitted path to
`.`, and gives policy and execution the same normalized
`Capability::Filesystem(Enumerate)` path. Allowed execution uses retained
descriptor-relative directory and no-follow traversal, reads no child content,
and returns at most 100 sorted retained entries and 16 KiB of aggregate raw
entry-name bytes plus a truncation flag. It reads only the first extra visible
entry needed to establish truncation, so a truncated subset may reflect
filesystem iteration order rather than global directory order. The exact
contract is in [`list-files.md`](list-files.md). The sixth slice adds the first
concrete `ModelProvider`: a bounded, executor-neutral Vercel AI Gateway protocol
`0.0.1` / language-model specification `4` codec over an explicitly injected
byte transport. It projects the supported core transcript into the request
shape exercised by pinned fx, strictly reconstructs text, reasoning, local tool
calls, usage and finish events from arbitrarily fragmented data-stream bytes,
independently bounds JSON nodes as well as bytes and counts, ignores unsupported
temperature and metadata after applicable structural validation, and makes one
cancellation-aware transport call after a valid request future is polled
through startup (and zero for an unpolled, pre-cancelled, or invalid request).
Empty chunks fail, bounded no-event work yields cooperatively, and cancellation
wins same-poll terminal races. The injected host retains endpoint, HTTP, TLS,
authentication, status and retry responsibility; this slice performs no
network effect itself. Its exact contract is in
[`ai-gateway.md`](ai-gateway.md). The seventh slice supplies an optional
native-only Reqwest/Rustls HTTP transport for that injected codec. It fixes the
production URL to `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v3/ai/language-model`, requires
an explicitly injected bounded bearer token, accepts plaintext only through an
explicit numeric-loopback test endpoint, and fixes proxy, redirect,
decompression, cookie, retry, timeout, active-request, status and diagnostic
policy. The concrete transport is polled on a host-owned Tokio runtime; core,
the codec and custom transports remain executor-neutral. Its exact contract is
in [`ai-gateway-http.md`](ai-gateway-http.md). Exact feature-branch review and
remote-run evidence is retained in the
[`native AI Gateway HTTP transport review`](reviews/m03-ai-gateway-http-review-01.md).
The slice is integrated on `main` at
`508b0adbbe4447a85bd08f47095ae16c089c05d5`; exact main CI run `32535790803`
and benchmark run `32535790824` are green.

The eighth slice adds a native `FileSessionStore` for supported Linux and
macOS Unix targets. A host supplies one existing absolute root whose opened
directory descriptor is retained; the store performs no environment discovery
or root creation. It maps validated session IDs through a fixed
domain-separated SHA-256 v1 layout, strictly stores one bounded versioned JSON
envelope per record, verifies the decoded ID, and implements optimistic new and
update saves with checked revision assignment. Permanent per-session advisory
lock sidecars coordinate cooperating processes. Bounded no-follow regular-file
reads and `0600` exclusive temporary writes, file sync, same-directory atomic
rename, and directory sync fail closed without repairing corrupt or nonregular
artifacts. Its futures are inert until polled but execute bounded synchronous
I/O, locking, and sync calls on the first polling thread. The exact contract is
in [`session-store.md`](session-store.md). Its exact feature,
documentation-seal, and `main` checks are green, with evidence in the
[`native file session store review`](reviews/m03-session-store-review-01.md).
It is integrated on `main` at
`8f7b47db9580b14570bf9fb55763858f71a81271`; exact main CI run `32541315998`
and benchmark run `32541315997` are green.

The ninth integrated bounded slice defines a
native, executor-neutral `AskPermissionHandler` over an explicitly injected
`PermissionPrompter`. `AskPermissionHandler::new` accepts an owned concrete
prompter and `AskPermissionHandler::shared_prompter` accepts an
`Arc<dyn PermissionPrompter>`. The adapter forwards core's complete bounded
`PermissionRequest` by value without cloning, mutation, serialization,
truncation, revalidation, or traversal. Structured allow-once, allow-turn,
allow-session, and deny results map exactly to the corresponding core decision;
neither core nor the adapter caches a positive grant. Denial uses the fixed
reason `permission denied`. The zero-data prompt error maps fail-closed to only
`permission_prompt_failed` / `permission prompt failed`.

Authorization is inert until polled, the prompt future remains owned by the
adapter future, and drop supplies cancellation by dropping that prompt future.
The adapter detaches no work and supplies no second cancellation token, so an
injected prompter must not leave a detached approval operation behind. It owns
no terminal, UI, environment, filesystem, process, network, configuration, or
runtime authority. The exact contract is in
[`ask-permission.md`](ask-permission.md). The implementation and black-box tests
are present. Three fresh adversarial reviews have no confirmed open findings;
the documentation seal and exact feature-SHA workflows are green; and the slice
is integrated on `main` at `27e3f2b3ff170044732d9124ffb210beabcda206`.
Exact main CI run `32570197911` and benchmark run `32570197870` are green. The
complete lineage is recorded in the
[`ask permission handler review`](reviews/m03-ask-permission-review-01.md).

The tenth integrated bounded slice uses the existing native
`ai-gateway-http` and non-WASM gate. It owns a separate
`AiGatewayCredentialEnvironment` snapshot containing only `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`
and `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`. A nonempty OIDC token has precedence over a nonempty
API key; unset and exactly empty values are absent; and any selected nonempty
non-Unicode, oversized, or malformed value fails closed without fallback.
Discovery consumes the snapshot and returns the selected source plus the
existing 1–4,096-byte RFC 6750 `AiGatewayBearerToken` without cloning it.
Errors have fixed missing, invalid-environment, and invalid-bearer categories
that retain and reflect no source or input. Accepted and retained data are
bounded, while process lookup may materialize a complete OS value before the
application can reject it. The exact contract is in
[`ai-gateway-credentials.md`](ai-gateway-credentials.md). This slice does not
add configuration credential fields or change core, the transport, or the CLI,
so the broader acquisition-and-configuration checklist item remains open.
Implementation, local gates,
and three fresh adversarial tracks are green at
`244e765713944b1bbe2ebca5bbbd02899c725e9f`. Exact feature CI run
`32573044224` and benchmark-evidence run `32573044159` are green for the
documentation seal at `ef6901d33c45f0b78b9ddf0042ad27b0ee1953c0`. That
SHA is integrated on `main`; exact main CI run `32573320962` and
benchmark-evidence run `32573320937` are green. The review lineage is in the
[`credential discovery review`](reviews/m03-ai-gateway-credential-review-01.md).

The eleventh bounded slice advances the built-in native configuration and
current file schema to strict v2. Its exact five-field object has integer
`schema_version: 2`, permission mode `ask`, provider `vercel_ai_gateway`,
transport `ai_gateway_http`, and default model `zai/glm-5.2`. The exact strict
two-field v1 object remains read-compatible: it maps only in memory to those
fixed provider, transport, and model values, keeps observable schema version
`1`, and is never rewritten or migrated. Both schemas exclude credentials.
Models share the AI Gateway provider's 1–128-byte visible-ASCII validator;
config owns and redacts its model in debug output. Provider, transport, and
model selections are declarative only and do not compose the codec, optional
HTTP transport, runtime, credential, network, core, or CLI. Status remains
metadata-only and existing CLI bytes are unchanged. The exact
contract and review lineage are in
[`configuration.md`](configuration.md) and the
[`native host configuration review`](reviews/m03-native-host-config-review-01.md).
Production implementation, black-box tests, documentation, three fresh
adversarial tracks, and exact feature and `main` gates are green. The slice is
integrated on `main` at `a10f24edde80a225f89e6c7068ec035cb70f80a8`;
exact main CI run `32576876769` and benchmark-evidence run `32576876780` are
green.

The twelfth bounded library slice is Linux/macOS-only and gated on the
existing `ai-gateway-http` feature and non-WebAssembly targets. Its
`NativeReferenceHost` consumes an already validated `LoadedNativeConfig` and
composes `AiGatewayProvider` over either production `AiGatewayHttpTransport`
from an injected credential snapshot or an explicit trusted custom transport,
one shared retained workspace identity feeding exactly `list_files` and
`read_file`, the existing `FileSessionStore` over a separately supplied existing
root, and `AskPermissionHandler` over an injected `PermissionPrompter`. It uses
default `EngineLimits` and the default no-op event sink. Constructors are
synchronous: they make no network request, poll no prompt, touch no session
record, create no root or runtime, and start no background work. Production
construction opens its non-secret roots before credential discovery and token
handoff. A production HTTP request later requires a host-owned, driven Tokio
runtime.

The host retains the exact loaded configuration, including file-backed schema
v1 as observable version `1` with its fixed projected provider, transport, and
model values. Production exposes only the selected non-secret credential-source
metadata; the custom-transport authority override reports no native-discovery
source and exposes no secret getter. Fixed stage-only errors and host debug
output are redacted. The CLI remains byte-unchanged and thin. The
[`composition contract`](native-reference-host.md),
[`review record`](reviews/m03-native-reference-host-review-01.md), production
implementation, independent black-box tests, three fresh adversarial tracks,
and exact feature and `main` workflows are green. Its final delivery record is
integrated on `main` at `ac3984fb16dbab3adf86a949c7555ceca7c3e8df`;
exact feature CI run `32579779134`, feature benchmark-evidence run
`32579779123`, main CI run `32580066474`, and main benchmark-evidence run
`32580066485` are green.

The thirteenth bounded slice advances the strict current native
configuration to schema v3. Its exact six-field object is the strict v2 shape
plus required non-secret `credential_source: "environment"` selection.
`NativeCredentialSourceKind::Environment`, its stable `environment` name, and
the `NativeConfig::credential_source` getter expose only that closed
acquisition kind. The built-in configuration is v3. Exact strict v1 and v2
files remain readable without rewrite or migration, retain their observable
schema versions, and project `Environment` only in memory; v2 rejects the new
field as unknown. The existing 64 KiB input cap, strict duplicate and unknown-
field failures, model bounds, and redacted diagnostics remain unchanged.

The production reference-host path validates `Environment` and then consumes
the already injected `AiGatewayCredentialEnvironment`. The loader gains no
process authority. Runtime `NativeReferenceHost::credential_source()` still
reports the concrete selected `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` or `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
source; the trusted custom-transport path still skips discovery and reports
`None`. No token bytes, arbitrary environment-variable names, persistence,
migration, auth-source compatibility, CLI behavior, or performance claim are
added. Production implementation, independent tests, and maintained docs are
integrated. Focused and required local gates and all three fresh adversarial tracks
are green on exact behavior/finding-fix SHA
`35ce591e8ca6a8fef94485ff85d3e9c1397130a6`. Documentation seal
`5f4deac672af85fe5c0b1be50c327ddbdd55ce9a` is feature-green under exact CI
run `32582210892` and benchmark-evidence run `32582210927`. Feature-evidence
record `8755757da0da07e33af48d57f46bd9ea490b5449` is green under exact feature
CI run `32582687145` and benchmark-evidence run `32582687169`, was fast-
forwarded without force to `main`, and is green there under exact CI run
`32582978232` and benchmark-evidence run `32582978286`. The contract and
lineage are in
[`configuration.md`](configuration.md) and the
[`configured credential-source review`](reviews/m03-configured-credential-source-review-01.md).

### Milestone 03 completion boundary

The thirteen integrated slices do not complete Milestone 03.
The following checklist is the frozen M03 boundary; changing ownership requires
an explicit plan change in a reviewed commit rather than silently deferring a
gate:

- [x] Integrate and retain evidence for slices one through eight.
- [x] Integrate the ninth ask-handler slice under its exact contract and
  retain feature, adversarial-review, exact-SHA CI, and `main` evidence.
- [x] Integrate the tenth credential-discovery slice under its exact
  contract and retain feature, adversarial-review, exact-SHA CI, and `main`
  evidence.
- [x] Integrate the eleventh native host configuration schema-v2 slice under
  its exact contract and retain feature, adversarial-review, exact-SHA CI, and
  `main` evidence.
- [x] Compose a useful native reference-host path through an explicitly selected
  provider and transport, session store, permission handler and prompter, and
  registered tools. The CLI stays a thin host and owns no product state.
  Implementation, independent tests, composed adversarial review, exact
  feature-SHA gates, fast-forward integration, and exact `main` gates are green.
- [x] Add bounded, redacted credential acquisition and the configuration fields
  required by that composition. Source precedence, missing/invalid behavior,
  size limits, and secret non-reflection must be normative and tested; core
  receives no ambient credential or configuration authority. The thirteenth
  slice supplies the bounded non-secret selection. Implementation, independent
  tests, all three fresh adversarial tracks, exact feature gates, fast-forward
  integration, and exact `main` gates are green.
- [ ] Add explicit workspace/state-root selection and safe required-root
  creation, plus native create, list, resume, replay, and reset session
  lifecycle behavior for the current schema. A reset under a reused session ID
  must allocate a new incarnation before reuse.
- [ ] Complete the M03 native tool set: `list_files`, `glob_files`,
  `grep_files`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `delete_file`,
  `rename_file`, `copy_file`, `create_folder`, `file_info`, `open_file`,
  `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `terminal`, `ask_user_question`, `vision`, and
  `read_tool_result`. Every authority-bearing tool requires normalized
  preflight, exact policy/execution agreement, resource bounds, redacted
  diagnostics, cancellation/drop tests, and platform scope stated before
  integration.
- [ ] Complete the M03 top-level CLI ownership from the pinned inventory:
  `help`, `ask`, `status`, `permissions`, `models`, `doctor`, `session`,
  `sessions`, `resume`, `replay`, and `workspace`. M03 also owns the pinned
  slash-command categories `general`, `session`, `model`, `security`, and
  `workspace`. Observable compatibility is scenario-based; command names may
  remain intentional differences when documented.
- [ ] Retain deterministic end-to-end evidence for the composed host with fake
  provider/prompt/network boundaries, exercise user-visible behavior through a
  freshly built release binary, resolve three fresh adversarial reviews, pass
  every required local and remote exact-SHA gate, and update the compatibility
  inventory/status without making a performance claim.

Ownership beyond that boundary is also fixed:

| Owner | Explicitly assigned work |
| --- | --- |
| M04 | Permission modes and identity-safe grant policy beyond `ask`; session schema migration and explicit legacy import; encryption, record authentication, key management, and secure erasure; persistence/lifecycle concurrency hardening; hardened non-Unix workspace and store construction. |
| M05 | Skills, MCP, ACP, and subagent infrastructure; top-level `acp`, `background`, and `teams`; extension/agent slash commands; built-in `memory`, `semantic_search`, `skill`, `install_skill`, `subagent`, `mcp_search_tools`, `mcp_select_tool`, and `mcp_features`. |
| M06 | SDK surfaces and remaining advanced compatibility, including top-level `pr`, `issue`, `login`, `logout`, `setup`, `credits`, `usage`, and `upgrade`, plus pinned account, media, product, and appearance slash-command categories. |
| M07 | Claim-eligible performance comparison, threshold enforcement, optimization, packaging evidence, and final hardening. Earlier milestones retain regression/size evidence needed by CI but make no product performance claim. |

Existing CLI bytes, benchmark evidence, workflows, and Zig inputs are unchanged
by the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth slices; Zig
remains only the pinned
upstream benchmark build input, not a machine-god product language or runtime
dependency. The provider is explicitly scoped to a pinned wire shape and makes
no current-protocol or full fx-equivalence claim. Help and status remain
claim-ineligible and unmeasured in bootstrap evidence.

## Release gates

- Formatting, Clippy with warnings denied, workspace tests on all four native
  target runners, doc tests, repo-wide Python unit tests, dependency policy, and
  vulnerability audit pass.
- Deterministic end-to-end tests pass on Linux and macOS, x86_64 and aarch64.
- Three equivalent local workloads beat pinned fx by at least 20%, no other
  equivalent workload regresses more than 5%, Linux local command startup is at
  most 2 ms, and the stripped Linux x86_64 binary is at most 7.8 MiB.
- Safety, permission, correctness, and resource-bound invariants cannot be
  weakened to meet performance targets.

## Authorization and stop conditions

The coordinator is authorized to commit and push branches and `main` to
`distributedstatemachine/machine-god`. It is not authorized to publish packages
or GitHub releases. Continue fixing ordinary implementation, review, benchmark,
and CI failures until green. Stop only for missing external authority, unavailable
required credentials/runners, irreproducible upstream behavior, or a conflict
between a performance goal and a security invariant.
