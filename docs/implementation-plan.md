# Implementation plan

Status values: `NOT STARTED`, `IN PROGRESS`, `BLOCKED`, `COMPLETE`.

## Objective

Build a high-performance Rust 1.94.1 coding-agent engine inspired by
`vercel-labs/fx`. Local development and CI use the declared minimum toolchain
exactly. Local `+stable` is a narrowly scoped fallback for this checkout's
damaged exact-toolchain installation and is valid only while both local Rust and
Cargo report release 1.94.1 exactly.
The embeddable asynchronous engine is the primary product; the CLI is its native
reference host. Observable performance and compatibility claims require retained
evidence against the pinned upstream revision. Product claims use committed,
reviewed summaries with input and result digests. The 90-day bootstrap workflow
artifact is non-product evidence of the collection path and may expire without
weakening those durable claim records.

## Delivery workflow

Every feature uses `agent/mNN-feature-slug`, isolated subagent worktrees, local
checks, three fresh adversarial reviewers, a pushed feature branch, remote CI for
the exact SHA, and a fast-forward push to `main`. Confirmed review findings are
fixed and rereviewed until none remain. Rejected findings are documented under
`docs/reviews/`. CI executes third-party actions by reviewed immutable commit,
keeps checkout credentials disabled, and grants the workflow read-only contents
permission. Python `test_*.py` files are discovered repo-wide in deterministic
order, excluding generated and checkout state under `.bench`, `.git`, and
`target`. Workspace tests execute natively on pinned Linux and macOS x86_64 and
aarch64 runner labels rather than relying on cross-compilation alone.

Milestone 02 completion evidence is retained in the
[milestone review](reviews/m02-milestone-review.md). Milestone 03 is in progress
with eight integrated bounded slices. The first
provides read-only native config/state
discovery, a fixed `ask` permission-mode report, and help/version/status CLI
behavior. The second adds synchronous read-only native loading of an exact
schema-v1 `ask` config, bounded to 64 KiB with fail-closed file and content
validation. Missing or unavailable configuration uses explicit built-in
defaults; configuration mutation is not implemented. The third adds
capability-aware tool preflight: the source-compatible default preserves the
raw `Capability::Tool` request, while a tool may prepare a normalized capability
and the exact arguments that an allowed execution receives. Core bounds the
prepared arguments at the existing exact byte limit and gives capability
serialization one total byte cap equal to that limit plus 1 KiB of fixed
headroom before policy. JSON depth and node traversal applies to the prepared
arguments and only the JSON values embedded in `Tool` or `Custom` capabilities.
Preparation is synchronous, bounded, nonblocking, effect-free trusted-host work
with immediate before/after cancellation checks; its arguments may drive only
effects within the authorized capability. Preparation failure produces a
durable generic tool error without consulting policy or exercising the tool.
The fourth slice adds the first executable native tool: a Unix-hardened,
read-only `read_file` capability rooted in an absolute workspace selected and
opened explicitly by the host. Its pure preflight accepts only a strict
`{path:string}` input, bounds that UTF-8 path at 4,096 bytes, and gives policy
and execution the same normalized workspace-relative path. Allowed execution
walks retained directory descriptors without following any component symlink,
accepts only a regular file, retains at most 8 KiB plus one overflow-detection
byte, and returns only valid UTF-8. The exact contract is in
[`read-file.md`](read-file.md). The fifth slice adds `list_files`, a
Unix-hardened, read-only, one-directory enumeration rooted in an explicit
absolute host path whose directory descriptor is retained. Its pure
preflight accepts only `{}` or a sole string `path`, defaults an omitted path to
`.`, and gives policy and execution the same normalized
`Capability::Filesystem(Enumerate)` path. Allowed execution uses retained
descriptor-relative directory and no-follow traversal, reads no child content,
and returns at most 100 sorted retained entries and 16 KiB of aggregate raw
entry-name bytes plus a truncation flag. It reads only the first extra visible
entry needed to establish truncation, so a truncated subset may reflect
filesystem iteration order rather than global directory order. The exact
contract is in [`list-files.md`](list-files.md). The sixth slice adds the first
concrete `ModelProvider`: a bounded, executor-neutral Vercel AI Gateway protocol
`0.0.1` / language-model specification `4` codec over an explicitly injected
byte transport. It projects the supported core transcript into the request
shape exercised by pinned fx, strictly reconstructs text, reasoning, local tool
calls, usage and finish events from arbitrarily fragmented data-stream bytes,
independently bounds JSON nodes as well as bytes and counts, ignores unsupported
temperature and metadata after applicable structural validation, and makes one
cancellation-aware transport call after a valid request future is polled
through startup (and zero for an unpolled, pre-cancelled, or invalid request).
Empty chunks fail, bounded no-event work yields cooperatively, and cancellation
wins same-poll terminal races. The injected host retains endpoint, HTTP, TLS,
authentication, status and retry responsibility; this slice performs no
network effect itself. Its exact contract is in
[`ai-gateway.md`](ai-gateway.md). The seventh slice supplies an optional
native-only Reqwest/Rustls HTTP transport for that injected codec. It fixes the
production URL to `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v3/ai/language-model`, requires
an explicitly injected bounded bearer token, accepts plaintext only through an
explicit numeric-loopback test endpoint, and fixes proxy, redirect,
decompression, cookie, retry, timeout, active-request, status and diagnostic
policy. The concrete transport is polled on a host-owned Tokio runtime; core,
the codec and custom transports remain executor-neutral. Its exact contract is
in [`ai-gateway-http.md`](ai-gateway-http.md). Exact feature-branch review and
remote-run evidence is retained in the
[`native AI Gateway HTTP transport review`](reviews/m03-ai-gateway-http-review-01.md).
The slice is integrated on `main` at
`508b0adbbe4447a85bd08f47095ae16c089c05d5`; exact main CI run `32535790803`
and benchmark run `32535790824` are green.

The eighth slice adds a native `FileSessionStore` for supported Linux and
macOS Unix targets. A host supplies one existing absolute root whose opened
directory descriptor is retained; the store performs no environment discovery
or root creation. It maps validated session IDs through a fixed
domain-separated SHA-256 v1 layout, strictly stores one bounded versioned JSON
envelope per record, verifies the decoded ID, and implements optimistic new and
update saves with checked revision assignment. Permanent per-session advisory
lock sidecars coordinate cooperating processes. Bounded no-follow regular-file
reads and `0600` exclusive temporary writes, file sync, same-directory atomic
rename, and directory sync fail closed without repairing corrupt or nonregular
artifacts. Its futures are inert until polled but execute bounded synchronous
I/O, locking, and sync calls on the first polling thread. The exact contract is
in [`session-store.md`](session-store.md). Its exact feature,
documentation-seal, and `main` checks are green, with evidence in the
[`native file session store review`](reviews/m03-session-store-review-01.md).
It is integrated on `main` at
`8f7b47db9580b14570bf9fb55763858f71a81271`; exact main CI run `32541315998`
and benchmark run `32541315997` are green.

The ninth bounded slice is a candidate, not an integrated slice. It defines a
native, executor-neutral `AskPermissionHandler` over an explicitly injected
`PermissionPrompter`. `AskPermissionHandler::new` accepts an owned concrete
prompter and `AskPermissionHandler::shared_prompter` accepts an
`Arc<dyn PermissionPrompter>`. The adapter forwards core's complete bounded
`PermissionRequest` by value without cloning, mutation, serialization,
truncation, revalidation, or traversal. Structured allow-once, allow-turn,
allow-session, and deny results map exactly to the corresponding core decision;
neither core nor the adapter caches a positive grant. Denial uses the fixed
reason `permission denied`. The zero-data prompt error maps fail-closed to only
`permission_prompt_failed` / `permission prompt failed`.

Authorization is inert until polled, the prompt future remains owned by the
adapter future, and drop supplies cancellation by dropping that prompt future.
The adapter detaches no work and supplies no second cancellation token, so an
injected prompter must not leave a detached approval operation behind. It owns
no terminal, UI, environment, filesystem, process, network, configuration, or
runtime authority. The exact candidate contract is in
[`ask-permission.md`](ask-permission.md). The implementation and black-box tests
are present on the feature branch. Three fresh adversarial reviews have no
confirmed open findings and exact feature-SHA remote CI and benchmark evidence
are green at `144c3512ef1f3d0e457f3a1c7b16bd8d0c2fb396`, as recorded in the
[`ask permission handler review`](reviews/m03-ask-permission-review-01.md).
This plan must continue to say "eight integrated slices and a ninth candidate"
until the documentation seal, fast-forward integration, and exact checks on
`main` are evidenced. Only then may the milestone summary be updated to nine
integrated slices.

### Milestone 03 completion boundary

The nine slices alone do not complete Milestone 03. The following checklist is
the frozen M03 boundary; changing ownership requires an explicit plan change in
a reviewed commit rather than silently deferring a gate:

- [x] Integrate and retain evidence for slices one through eight.
- [ ] Integrate the ninth ask-handler candidate under its exact contract and
  retain feature, adversarial-review, exact-SHA CI, and `main` evidence.
- [ ] Compose a useful native reference-host path through an explicitly selected
  provider and transport, session store, permission handler and prompter, and
  registered tools. The CLI stays a thin host and owns no product state.
- [ ] Add bounded, redacted credential acquisition and the configuration fields
  required by that composition. Source precedence, missing/invalid behavior,
  size limits, and secret non-reflection must be normative and tested; core
  receives no ambient credential or configuration authority.
- [ ] Add explicit workspace/state-root selection and safe required-root
  creation, plus native create, list, resume, replay, and reset session
  lifecycle behavior for the current schema. A reset under a reused session ID
  must allocate a new incarnation before reuse.
- [ ] Complete the M03 native tool set: `list_files`, `glob_files`,
  `grep_files`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `delete_file`,
  `rename_file`, `copy_file`, `create_folder`, `file_info`, `open_file`,
  `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `terminal`, `ask_user_question`, `vision`, and
  `read_tool_result`. Every authority-bearing tool requires normalized
  preflight, exact policy/execution agreement, resource bounds, redacted
  diagnostics, cancellation/drop tests, and platform scope stated before
  integration.
- [ ] Complete the M03 top-level CLI ownership from the pinned inventory:
  `help`, `ask`, `status`, `permissions`, `models`, `doctor`, `session`,
  `sessions`, `resume`, `replay`, and `workspace`. M03 also owns the pinned
  slash-command categories `general`, `session`, `model`, `security`, and
  `workspace`. Observable compatibility is scenario-based; command names may
  remain intentional differences when documented.
- [ ] Retain deterministic end-to-end evidence for the composed host with fake
  provider/prompt/network boundaries, exercise user-visible behavior through a
  freshly built release binary, resolve three fresh adversarial reviews, pass
  every required local and remote exact-SHA gate, and update the compatibility
  inventory/status without making a performance claim.

Ownership beyond that boundary is also fixed:

| Owner | Explicitly assigned work |
| --- | --- |
| M04 | Permission modes and identity-safe grant policy beyond `ask`; session schema migration and explicit legacy import; encryption, record authentication, key management, and secure erasure; persistence/lifecycle concurrency hardening; hardened non-Unix workspace and store construction. |
| M05 | Skills, MCP, ACP, and subagent infrastructure; top-level `acp`, `background`, and `teams`; extension/agent slash commands; built-in `memory`, `semantic_search`, `skill`, `install_skill`, `subagent`, `mcp_search_tools`, `mcp_select_tool`, and `mcp_features`. |
| M06 | SDK surfaces and remaining advanced compatibility, including top-level `pr`, `issue`, `login`, `logout`, `setup`, `credits`, `usage`, and `upgrade`, plus pinned account, media, product, and appearance slash-command categories. |
| M07 | Claim-eligible performance comparison, threshold enforcement, optimization, packaging evidence, and final hardening. Earlier milestones retain regression/size evidence needed by CI but make no product performance claim. |

Existing CLI bytes, benchmark evidence, workflows, and Zig inputs are unchanged
by the ninth candidate; Zig remains only the pinned upstream benchmark build
input, not a machine-god product language or runtime dependency. The provider
is explicitly scoped to a pinned wire shape and makes no current-protocol or
full fx-equivalence claim. Help and status remain claim-ineligible and
unmeasured in bootstrap evidence.

## Release gates

- Formatting, Clippy with warnings denied, workspace tests on all four native
  target runners, doc tests, repo-wide Python unit tests, dependency policy, and
  vulnerability audit pass.
- Deterministic end-to-end tests pass on Linux and macOS, x86_64 and aarch64.
- Three equivalent local workloads beat pinned fx by at least 20%, no other
  equivalent workload regresses more than 5%, Linux local command startup is at
  most 2 ms, and the stripped Linux x86_64 binary is at most 7.8 MiB.
- Safety, permission, correctness, and resource-bound invariants cannot be
  weakened to meet performance targets.

## Authorization and stop conditions

The coordinator is authorized to commit and push branches and `main` to
`distributedstatemachine/machine-god`. It is not authorized to publish packages
or GitHub releases. Continue fixing ordinary implementation, review, benchmark,
and CI failures until green. Stop only for missing external authority, unavailable
required credentials/runners, irreproducible upstream behavior, or a conflict
between a performance goal and a security invariant.
