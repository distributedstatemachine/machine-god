# Implementation plan

Status values: `NOT STARTED`, `IN PROGRESS`, `BLOCKED`, `COMPLETE`.

## Objective

Build a high-performance Rust 1.94.1 coding-agent engine inspired by
`vercel-labs/fx`. Local development and CI use the declared minimum toolchain
exactly. Local `+stable` is a narrowly scoped fallback for this checkout's
damaged exact-toolchain installation and is valid only while both local Rust and
Cargo report release 1.94.1 exactly.
The embeddable asynchronous engine is the primary product; the CLI is its native
reference host. Observable performance and compatibility claims require retained
evidence against the pinned upstream revision. Product claims use committed,
reviewed summaries with input and result digests. The 90-day bootstrap workflow
artifact is non-product evidence of the collection path and may expire without
weakening those durable claim records.

## Delivery workflow

Every feature uses `agent/mNN-feature-slug`, isolated subagent worktrees, local
checks, three fresh adversarial reviewers, a pushed feature branch, remote CI for
the exact SHA, and a fast-forward push to `main`. Confirmed review findings are
fixed and rereviewed until none remain. Rejected findings are documented under
`docs/reviews/`. CI executes third-party actions by reviewed immutable commit,
keeps checkout credentials disabled, and grants the workflow read-only contents
permission. Python `test_*.py` files are discovered repo-wide in deterministic
order, excluding generated and checkout state under `.bench`, `.git`, and
`target`. Workspace tests execute natively on pinned Linux and macOS x86_64 and
aarch64 runner labels rather than relying on cross-compilation alone.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Deliverable | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Repository, docs, CI, workspace, upstream benchmark harness, and non-product bootstrap evidence | COMPLETE |
| 02 | Provider-neutral streaming engine and deterministic testkit | COMPLETE |
| 03 | Providers, native tools, permissions, sessions, config, and CLI | IN PROGRESS |
| 04 | Security, lifecycle, concurrency, and persistence hardening | NOT STARTED |
| 05 | Skills, MCP, ACP, and subagent extensibility | NOT STARTED |
| 06 | SDK surfaces and advanced compatibility | NOT STARTED |
| 07 | Optimization, packaging evidence, and final hardening | NOT STARTED |

Milestone 02 completion evidence is retained in the
[milestone review](reviews/m02-milestone-review.md). Milestone 03 is in progress
with three bounded slices. The first provides read-only native config/state
discovery, a fixed `ask` permission-mode report, and help/version/status CLI
behavior. The second adds synchronous read-only native loading of an exact
schema-v1 `ask` config, bounded to 64 KiB with fail-closed file and content
validation. Missing or unavailable configuration uses explicit built-in
defaults; configuration mutation is not implemented. The third adds
capability-aware tool preflight: the source-compatible default preserves the
raw `Capability::Tool` request, while a tool may prepare a normalized capability
and the exact arguments that an allowed execution receives. Core bounds the
prepared values before policy, and preparation failure produces a durable
generic tool error without consulting policy or exercising the tool. These
slices do not complete Milestone 03. The next planned slice is the first
read-only native `read_file` tool. Concrete providers, permission prompting and
modes beyond `ask`, durable native sessions, broader configuration and CLI
behavior, the remaining executable native tools, and compatibility or
performance claims remain planned. Existing CLI bytes are unchanged, and the
help and status commands remain explicitly non-equivalent, claim-ineligible,
and unmeasured in bootstrap evidence.

## Release gates

- Formatting, Clippy with warnings denied, workspace tests on all four native
  target runners, doc tests, repo-wide Python unit tests, dependency policy, and
  vulnerability audit pass.
- Deterministic end-to-end tests pass on Linux and macOS, x86_64 and aarch64.
- Three equivalent local workloads beat pinned fx by at least 20%, no other
  equivalent workload regresses more than 5%, Linux local command startup is at
  most 2 ms, and the stripped Linux x86_64 binary is at most 7.8 MiB.
- Safety, permission, correctness, and resource-bound invariants cannot be
  weakened to meet performance targets.

## Authorization and stop conditions

The coordinator is authorized to commit and push branches and `main` to
`distributedstatemachine/machine-god`. It is not authorized to publish packages
or GitHub releases. Continue fixing ordinary implementation, review, benchmark,
and CI failures until green. Stop only for missing external authority, unavailable
required credentials/runners, irreproducible upstream behavior, or a conflict
between a performance goal and a security invariant.
