# machine-god

`machine-god` is an experimental, embeddable coding-agent engine written in Rust.

The engine is the primary product. The command-line application is its native
reference host. Development status, architecture, compatibility, security, and
performance evidence live in [`docs/`](docs/README.md).

Milestones 01 and 02 are complete, and Milestone 03 is in progress. The
repository includes the provider-neutral streaming engine, its bounded durable
tool loop, a deterministic testkit, read-only native configuration/status
discovery and loading, and capability-aware tool preflight before permission
policy. It also includes bounded Unix-only `read_file` and one-level
`list_files` library capabilities rooted in host-injected workspaces, plus a
bounded AI Gateway codec over an injected host transport. An optional,
native-only HTTPS transport for that codec is the seventh integrated bounded
slice. It uses one pinned production endpoint and an explicitly injected,
redacted bearer token.
An eighth bounded slice implements a Unix file-backed session store under an
explicit host-opened root. Its exact feature, documentation-seal, and `main`
checks are green; it is integrated at
`8f7b47db9580b14570bf9fb55763858f71a81271`. Provider/CLI wiring, a concrete
prompt UI, broader session lifecycle features, the remaining
native tools, and compatibility work remain planned. A ninth bounded slice
defines an executor-neutral, fail-closed native `AskPermissionHandler` over an
explicitly injected prompter. It is integrated on `main` at
`27e3f2b3ff170044732d9124ffb210beabcda206`; exact main CI run `32570197911`
and benchmark run `32570197870` are green. It has no CLI or terminal authority.
See its [contract](docs/ask-permission.md).
The tenth integrated bounded slice adds opt-in native discovery of a validated
AI Gateway bearer credential from an owned, redacted environment snapshot. It
is integrated on `main` at
`ef6901d33c45f0b78b9ddf0042ad27b0ee1953c0`; exact main CI run `32573320962`
and benchmark run `32573320937` are green. It does not change configuration
or CLI behavior; see its
[contract](docs/ai-gateway-credentials.md).
The eleventh integrated bounded slice advances the built-in native
configuration and current file schema to strict v2 with fixed declarative AI
Gateway provider, HTTP transport, and `zai/glm-5.2` model defaults. The exact
strict two-field v1 file remains read-compatible without rewrite or migration
and remains observable as schema v1 after its in-memory projection. Credentials
are in neither schema, and the new fields do not compose a provider, HTTP client,
runtime, token, network request, or CLI path. The feature implementation,
black-box tests, documentation, three adversarial tracks, and exact feature and
`main` gates are green. It is integrated on `main` at
`a10f24edde80a225f89e6c7068ec035cb70f80a8`; exact main CI run `32576876769`
and benchmark-evidence run `32576876780` are green. See the
[native configuration contract](docs/configuration.md) and
[review record](docs/reviews/m03-native-host-config-review-01.md).

A twelfth bounded library candidate implements `NativeReferenceHost` for Linux
and macOS behind the optional `ai-gateway-http` and non-WebAssembly gate. It
composes an already validated native configuration with the AI Gateway
provider, either production HTTP from an injected credential snapshot or a
trusted injected custom transport, one shared retained workspace feeding
exactly `list_files` and `read_file`, the existing file session store, and the
ask handler over an injected prompter. Construction remains synchronous and
creates no root, runtime, network request, prompt operation, session record, or
background work. Production implementation and independent black-box tests are
composed on this feature branch, their focused pinned-toolchain checks are
green, and three fresh adversarial tracks are green on exact behavior SHA
`5afda631`. Exact remote gates and `main` delivery remain pending. The CLI is
byte-unchanged and remains thin. See
the [candidate contract](docs/native-reference-host.md) and
[candidate review record](docs/reviews/m03-native-reference-host-review-01.md).

The project is not yet production-ready. See the exact
[CLI contract](docs/cli.md),
[`read_file` contract](docs/read-file.md),
[`list_files` contract](docs/list-files.md), and
[AI Gateway codec](docs/ai-gateway.md) plus
[native HTTP transport](docs/ai-gateway-http.md) and
[credential discovery](docs/ai-gateway-credentials.md) contracts, and the
normative [native file session store](docs/session-store.md) plus the candidate
[native reference-host composition](docs/native-reference-host.md).

The Rust project is licensed under Apache-2.0. It is inspired by
[`vercel-labs/fx`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/fx), whose pinned comparison
revision is recorded in `benchmarks/upstream.lock`. Zig is pinned only to build
that upstream benchmark reference; it is not a machine-god product language or
runtime dependency.
