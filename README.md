# machine-god

`machine-god` is an experimental, embeddable coding-agent engine written in Rust.

The engine is the primary product. The command-line application is its native
reference host. Development status, architecture, compatibility, security, and
performance evidence live in [`docs/`](docs/README.md).

Milestones 01 and 02 are complete, and Milestone 03 is in progress. The
repository includes the provider-neutral streaming engine, its bounded durable
tool loop, a deterministic testkit, read-only native configuration/status
discovery and loading, and capability-aware tool preflight before permission
policy. It also includes bounded Unix-only `read_file` and one-level
`list_files` library capabilities rooted in host-injected workspaces, plus a
bounded AI Gateway codec over an injected host transport. An optional,
native-only HTTPS transport for that codec is the seventh integrated bounded
slice. It uses one pinned production endpoint and an explicitly injected,
redacted bearer token.
An eighth bounded slice implements a Unix file-backed session store under an
explicit host-opened root. Its exact feature, documentation-seal, and `main`
checks are green; it is integrated at
`8f7b47db9580b14570bf9fb55763858f71a81271`. Provider/CLI wiring, a concrete
prompt UI, broader session lifecycle features, the remaining
native tools, and compatibility work remain planned. A ninth bounded slice
defines an executor-neutral, fail-closed native `AskPermissionHandler` over an
explicitly injected prompter. It is integrated on `main` at
`27e3f2b3ff170044732d9124ffb210beabcda206`; exact main CI run `32570197911`
and benchmark run `32570197870` are green. It has no CLI or terminal authority.
See its [contract](docs/ask-permission.md).
The tenth integrated bounded slice adds opt-in native discovery of a validated
AI Gateway bearer credential from an owned, redacted environment snapshot. It
is integrated on `main` at
`ef6901d33c45f0b78b9ddf0042ad27b0ee1953c0`; exact main CI run `32573320962`
and benchmark run `32573320937` are green. It does not change configuration
or CLI behavior; see its
[contract](docs/ai-gateway-credentials.md).
An eleventh bounded candidate advances the built-in native configuration and
current file schema to strict v2 with fixed declarative AI Gateway provider,
HTTP transport, and `zai/glm-5.2` model defaults. The exact strict two-field v1
file remains read-compatible without rewrite or migration and remains
observable as schema v1 after its in-memory projection. Credentials are in
neither schema, and the new fields do not compose a provider, HTTP client,
runtime, token, network request, or CLI path. The feature implementation,
black-box tests, and candidate documentation are composed on its feature
branch; final adversarial rereview, exact-SHA remote gates, and `main` delivery
remain pending. See the
[native configuration contract](docs/configuration.md) and
[candidate review record](docs/reviews/m03-native-host-config-review-01.md).
The project is not yet production-ready. See the exact
[CLI contract](docs/cli.md),
[`read_file` contract](docs/read-file.md),
[`list_files` contract](docs/list-files.md), and
[AI Gateway codec](docs/ai-gateway.md) plus
[native HTTP transport](docs/ai-gateway-http.md) and
[credential discovery](docs/ai-gateway-credentials.md) contracts, and the
normative [native file session store](docs/session-store.md).

The Rust project is licensed under Apache-2.0. It is inspired by
[`vercel-labs/fx`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/fx), whose pinned comparison
revision is recorded in `benchmarks/upstream.lock`. Zig is pinned only to build
that upstream benchmark reference; it is not a machine-god product language or
runtime dependency.
